# Custom User Model with Token-Based Authentication in Django

This Django project uses a custom user model and token-based authentication to manage user accounts and secure access to resources. The custom model extends the default Django `AbstractUser` model, adding fields such as a biography (`bio`), profile picture (`profile_picture`), and a self-referencing `followers` field to allow users to follow each other.

---

## Custom User Model

The project defines a custom user model, `CustomUser`, which extends Djangoâ€™s built-in `AbstractUser`. This allows for additional flexibility in the user profile, while retaining the core fields (`username`, `password`, `email`, etc.) provided by Django.

### Model Fields

- **`bio`**: A `TextField` that allows users to add a short description about themselves. It is optional and can be left blank.
  
- **`profile_picture`**: An `ImageField` where users can upload their profile picture. The images are stored in the directory specified in `upload_to='profile_pictures/'`. This field is optional.

- **`followers`**: A self-referencing `ManyToManyField` with `symmetrical=False`, which allows users to follow other users without requiring the follow to be mutual. This field creates a relationship between users and is stored in the database without enforcing a reciprocal relationship.

# Post and Comment API Documentation

## Overview

This project implements a basic API where users can create, read, update, and delete posts and comments. The API includes models for `Post` and `Comment`, serialization logic, CRUD views, and additional enhancements like pagination and filtering.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Post and Comment Models

Two models, `Post` and `Comment`, were created in a new app called `posts`.

- **Post Model**: Represents a blog post with fields like:
  - `author`: ForeignKey to the `User` model.
  - `title`: Title of the post.
  - `content`: Body of the post.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp when the post was created.
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp when the post was last updated.

- **Comment Model**: Represents comments on posts with fields like:
  - `post`: ForeignKey to the `Post` model.
  - `author`: ForeignKey to the `User` model.
  - `content`: Body of the comment.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp when the comment was created.
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp when the comment was last updated.
